We\u2019re not very close friends, but we know each other well enough to have visited each other\u2019s houses for dinner and drinks a few times.<\/p>\n<p>His business is advertising a role which interests me. I have suitable skills for this role but limited experience, so it\u2019s likely to get better candidates than I \u2013 at least on paper. It is reporting to one of his subordinates, and I have no idea how much (if any) input my friend might have into the recruiting process.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to apply for this job but I don\u2019t want to cause problems for my friend, nor to have our friendship unduly influence the recruiting process. I have not yet spoken to my friend about it because doing so would certainly result in the latter outcome.<\/p>\n<p>They work in quite a small office. There is a strong chance that, were I to manage to get to the interview stage anonymously, my friend would see me when I arrived. But I also know he\u2019s out of the office a lot.<\/p>\n<p>How should I proceed? I am happy to consider that \u201cnot proceeding\u201d may be the best course of action here, especially given that I may well not get the job.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","question-category":[4],"question_tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question\/110"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/question"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=110"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=110"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"question-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question-category?post=110"},{"taxonomy":"question_tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question_tags?post=110"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
