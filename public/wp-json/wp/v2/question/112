Often I get tasks that I have real difficulty with. I flag this: I say that I\u2019ve never done that before and I\u2019ll have difficulty. I get some help, but the task always takes way longer than estimated and is done pretty badly. This puts me under a huge amount of stress and is embarrassing as my tasks often get rejected at QA.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m all for learning but its just too much. I need to master things incrementally, not all at once.
