I have the impression that, in these cases, the candidate internally knows they are not getting the job, and would just like to end things as soon as possible (as would I).<\/p>\n<p>In the past, I have handled phone interviews of this type by ending a little early and giving a standard closing. However, I have empathy for the candidates and would feel better if I could say something nice without being dishonest. They\u2019re not getting the job, but I may still respect them and honestly wish them well. I\u2019m not really sure how I could tactfully express thoughts like this, though.<\/p>\n<p>My question is mainly about phone-based interviews, but I\u2019m interested in answers that also apply to in-person interviews. To be clear, this question is how, specifically, to be nice at the end of a bad interview, so I\u2019m looking for something more specific than simply ask how to end a bad interview. (Hence I don\u2019t consider this a duplicate of questions asking how to end a bad interview.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","question-category":[7],"question_tags":[32,34],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question\/115"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/question"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=115"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=115"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"question-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question-category?post=115"},{"taxonomy":"question_tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/2code.info\/demo\/themes\/Discy\/Main\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/question_tags?post=115"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
